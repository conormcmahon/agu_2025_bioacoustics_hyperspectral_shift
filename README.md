This is a placeholder website. Check back soon for more information on the project. 

Things to add:

* Species-specific, scale-dependent plots of trait relationships
* Tree vs. grass trait patterns
* More spatial data
* Confidence models for each species


# Data Sources

Plant traits data were developed during and following the 2022 Surface Biology and Geology HIgh Frequency Timeseries (SHIFT) project. All traits data are available online at:
