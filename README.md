# Data Sources

Plant traits data were developed during and following the 2022 Surface Biology and Geology HIgh Frequency Timeseries (SHIFT) project. All traits data are available online at: 

Zheng, T., N. Queally, C. Ade, P.G. Brodrick, K.D. Chadwick, and P.A. Townsend. 2025. SHIFT: AVIRIS-NG Derived Plant Functional Trait Mosaics. ORNL DAAC, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA.

More documentation is available from the manuscript:

# Example Photos

Additional versions are available for most plots shown on the primary poster. These primarily show greater levels of detail for species-trait or other response-driver relationships which did not fit on the poster but might still be interesting to some viewers. For these, see the list below. Each link is to a page containing a folder of images, after an example. **Click the images to see more representative examples.** For additional context, see the poster.
