Things to add:

* Species-specific, scale-dependent plots of trait relationships
* Tree vs. grass trait patterns
* More spatial data
* Confidence models for each species


# Data Sources

Plant traits data were developed during and following the 2022 Surface Biology and Geology HIgh Frequency Timeseries (SHIFT) project. All traits data are available online at: 

[SHIFT Plant Traits](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=2453)

# Example Photos

Additional versions are available for most plots shown on the primary poster. These primarily show greater levels of detail for species-trait or other response-driver relationships which did not fit on the poster but might still be interesting to some viewers. For these, see the list below. Each link is to a page containing a folder of images, after an example.
